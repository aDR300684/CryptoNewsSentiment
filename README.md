# Sentiment Analysis of Cryptocurrency News Articles

Welcome to the "CryptoNewsSentiment" project. This initiative is a part of my ongoing exploration into machine learning, focusing on sentiment analysis of cryptocurrency news articles.

## Dataset

The primary dataset for this project is "SahandNZ/cryptonews-articles-with-price-momentum-labels," obtained from Hugging Face Datasets. It consists of news articles gathered from Cryptonews.com and Binance.com, aiming to analyze the impact of news on cryptocurrency prices and market sentiment. The dataset includes articles' text, publication dates, source URLs, and sentiment labels.

More details on the dataset can be found at the repository: [SahandNZ Cryptonews Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SahandNZ/cryptonews-articles-with-price-momentum-labels)

## Project Setup

Instructions on setting up this project will be added soon, including steps for cloning the repository, installing necessary dependencies, and any other required configuration.

## Usage

This section will include guidelines on how to run the project and utilize its features. Detailed instructions will be provided as the project develops.
