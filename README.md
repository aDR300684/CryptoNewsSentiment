# Sentiment Analysis of Cryptocurrency News Articles

Welcome to the "CryptoNewsSentiment" project, a deep dive into machine learning with a focus on sentiment analysis of cryptocurrency news articles.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the "SahandNZ/cryptonews-articles-with-price-momentum-labels" dataset from Hugging Face Datasets. Comprising articles from Cryptonews.com and Binance.com, it's designed to analyze the impact of news on cryptocurrency prices and market sentiment. The dataset includes article text, publication dates, source URLs, and sentiment labels.

Repository: [SahandNZ Cryptonews Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SahandNZ/cryptonews-articles-with-price-momentum-labels)

## Project Setup

To set up this project, clone the repository, install the required dependencies (listed in a `requirements.txt` file), and follow the Jupyter Notebook for detailed instructions and code.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our extensive EDA has yielded valuable insights:

- **Sentiment Distribution**: Analyzed the balance of sentiments across the dataset.
- **Article Length Analysis**: Investigated article lengths to identify content density and verbosity patterns.
- **Common Words and Phrases**: Examined frequent topics in the news articles through word cloud visualization and frequency analysis.
- **Temporal Trends**: Explored how article frequency and sentiment change over time, potentially reflecting market reactions.

These findings have been crucial in understanding the dataset's nuances and will guide our subsequent model development.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook `ML_CryptoNews.ipynb` to follow our EDA steps and view the visualizations and analyses conducted.

## Model Development

(Currently in progress) - Details about model building, training, and validation will be elaborated here.

## Results and Interpretation

(To be added) - We will discuss our findings and interpretations from the sentiment analysis of the news articles.
